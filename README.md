- 👋 Hi, I’m @MelvaMud
- 👀 I’m interested in: Sculpting odd creatures (like my profile photo), Python3, Linux, IoT, Cyber Security...honestly, there's just too much to list here.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in a Cyber Security program at DeVry University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will give me hands on experience. My skills may be limited right now, but hopefully, not for long.
- 📫 How to reach me at MelvaMud@gmail.com. Please let me know you're from GitHub so I don't ignore your email.
